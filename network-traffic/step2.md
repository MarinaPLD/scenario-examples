# Step 2: Configure BunkerWeb

BunkerWeb uses a configuration file called `bunkerweb.yml` to define its behavior. In this scenario, a custom configuration file is already provided.

### View the Configuration File

Use the following command to inspect the `bunkerweb.yml` file:

```bash
nano bunkerweb.yml
```{{exec}}

This file enables default security policies for the web server. You can customize it further if needed.

Once verified, proceed to the next step to access the BunkerWeb UI.
