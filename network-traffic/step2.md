Now that the BunkerWeb stack is up and running, let's explore the BunkerWeb UI to manage settings and monitor security.

## Access BunkerWeb UI

Once the ui container is running, you can access the BunkerWeb setup wizard via this link:

**Disclaimer**: You can safely ignore the service name `webui.example.com`, this is just a placeholder for the tutorial. As we access the web UI and do not go through BunkerWeb's reverse proxy, it doesn't matter what the service name is. (We have to proceed this way because Killercoda about redirection)

## Setup Wizard

The setup wizard will guide you through the initial configuration of BunkerWeb. You will be asked to set up the following:

1. **Admin User**: Create an admin user to access the BunkerWeb UI.

Once you have completed the setup wizard, you will be redirected to the login page.
